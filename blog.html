    This is a channel I used to watch DAILY, spanning from their <a href="https://youtu.be/1_hKLfTKU5Y?si=fawF50lkL-Y5YAJ1">"Mario Bros vs Wright Bros"</a>to <a href="https://youtu.be/17CLlZuiBkQ?si=sT8Ghm3DoDe-zBm_">"Batman vs Sherlock Holmes"</a> to their probably most recognizable <a href="https://youtu.be/AFA-rOls8YA?si=d9NPs4PQXAZlZnEK">Hitler vs Darth Vader" (Trilogy)</a>. Yes, it was a trilogy—technically. Honestly, a lot of popular videos besides gaming were music/parodies. like the <a href="https://youtu.be/6cx1WaoWQ34?si=Owq4_l4rEfeiASUR">Sans and Papyrus Song - An Undertale Rap</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/S9uTScSgzrM?si=a76JEBIwOeIleKwq">OVERWATCH: No Mercy</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/l18A5BOTlzE?si=9s1uOJhk74v1WTvT">Five Nights at Freddy's 1 Song</a>, or any of <a href="https://youtu.be/cPJUBQd-PNM?si=0Ih3gUJtQ9jPGSMq">Captain Sparklez's Minecraft parodies</a>, but also channels like <a href="https://youtu.be/IbWbj8WX-Zo?si=YXVFFZR8zDsKsxUz">Bart Baker</a> were crazy. 
    Hell, might as well throw <a href="https://youtu.be/N9qYF9DZPdw?si=lFq5nATBM1j_3Hsn">Weird Al</a> into the mix.

<p>
    Getting sidetracked, back to Artist vs TMNT. This was huge, and even now, I personally think it still holds up. If you’re as old as me, you will recognize Rhett and Link -> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GoodMythicalMorning">Good Mythical Morning</a> and Ian and Anthony -> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@smosh">SMOSH</a>.
</p>
<h3>if you don’t know, here’s a quick summary:</h3>
<p>
    <a href="https://youtu.be/yltM5dyCQek?si=DuYtq8FuPrifResB">SMOSH</a>: Made in 2005, it was one of the earliest YouTube sensations with their sketches and parodies. But in 2017, Anthony left SMOSH to pursue solo projects, while the brand continued under Defy Media. In 2018, Defy Media shut down. However, Rhett & Link’s company, Mythical Entertainment, acquired SMOSH in early 2019. Nothing too significant until June 2023, when Anthony returned to SMOSH, reuniting with Ian and regaining full control over SMOSH.

    <a href="https://youtu.be/g0OdOMd5hO4?si=9mfpzYJNCcXLv1Ce">Good Mythical Morning</a>: Good Mythical Morning (GMM) is like a talk show created by Rhett and Link. They launched GMM in 2012 as part of their broader YouTube channel, Rhett & Link, which featured comedy, challenges, and experiments. Over the years, Rhett and Link expanded their brand by founding Mythical Entertainment, a media company that bought SMOSH and sold it back to Rhett and Link, as I previously said.

    Anyway, these four giants on YouTube on another huge channel were like the Avengers: Endgame of YouTube. After the introductions, the beat is perfect; the bass and the flow—chef’s kiss. The verses are written so well; the charm and commitment they had for this video are great. Don’t take my word for it; look at the stats: 100M views.
Here are some of the comments:
<ul>
    <li>“Literally the strongest opening verse in ERB.”</li>
    <li>“The only flaw in this masterpiece is that it’s not long enough.”</li>
    <li>“Next: egg vs egg vs egg vs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HowToBasic">howtobasic</a>…”</li>
</ul>
<p>… another huge channel for their weird how-to “tutorials.”</p>
</p>
<p>
    <h1>The Artist</h1>
    Now, I could go into depth and research how these verses are amazing…and I am. But let’s start with Raphael (Anthony) – “deemed by the pope,” (gestures sign of the cross → straight into a thrusting motion) “and boned 'til I croaked.” 
    <br>
    <br>
    There is a famous story about Raphael’s death being linked to his wild sexual activity. However, since this is history, it could all be exaggerated or not true.

    <br>
    <br>

    Giorgio Vasari, in his Lives of the Artists, claims that Raphael died from a fever caused by excessive lovemaking. According to Vasari, Raphael hid the true cause of his illness from his doctors, leading them to treat him incorrectly with bloodletting, which worsened his condition and ultimately led to his death.

    I don’t know what the true cause of death is—but some point to pneumonia, syphilis, or a pulmonary disease.
    <br>
    <br>
    Then he references Shredder, like the villain of TMNT, but afterwards he drops another peak bar, “I should pass it up to my man on the ceiling,” referencing Michelangelo (Ian), because he painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel (you know, the Creation of Adam).
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        But funny enough, historically, they had a fierce rivalry. So for Raphael to say “passing it to my man on the ceiling” like he is his bro—just to team up against the Ninja Turtles—is a crazy idea.
    </p>
    <p>
        Michelangelo follows up with, “I’m a rap god, and you can’t quite touch me,” obviously referencing Eminem, but also referencing his art on the Sistine Chapel—cause in the painting of Adam and God – their hands or fingers aren’t touching, symbolizing the gap between God and man. Then he says, “This battle's your Last Judgment, trust me!”—because he painted “The Last Judgment,” aka the coming of Jesus and the final and eternal judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then it ends with, in unison, “You beat the Foot, but it won't go well when you catch an Italian boot to the half shell!” a mocking line of the TMNT theme “Heroes in a half shell.” It also implies that the Turtles were able to defeat the Foot (Shredder's army, basically), but will still fail under the artists’ boot. Also, the country itself is famously shaped like a boot.
    </p>
    <h1>TMNT</h1>
    <p>
        —this sounded like shit, but I have to appreciate the costume design, which was based on the original Jim Henson live-action films, as well as the effort required to actually move in them. The lyrics also had hidden meanings just not as cool.
    </p>
    <p>
        Leonardo says, “Get back in your floppy helicopter, fly away!” cause Leonardo (artist) designed his version of a helicopter, but this was a jab at him cause Leonardo’s engineering designs were “flops”.
        This is followed by Raphael saying, “Put you back in school with the tip of my two sai,” because the other Raphael (the Renaissance artist) made a fresco called the School of Athens. These are good references, but not strong bars.
    </p>
    <p>But the final part of video gives us two BANGER – starting with Donatello. “Uh, Dona-tell me who you are again, dude, 'Cause I don't Gattamelata clue what you do.” 
        Donatello is mocking the artist Donatello for his insignificance - For context, out of all the artists, Donatello is the least well-known. while also referencing the 1453 statue of Gattamelata sculpted by Donatello. 
    </p>
    <p>Finally, I want to point out the line, “You guys draw more dicks than New York Pride,” which is kind of self-explanatory…. </p>

<h2>NOW FOR STEVE JOBS VS BILL GATES </h2> 
<p>THIS IS MY SHIT, GET READY FOR THIS. 
    BEING A COMPUTER NERD AND JUST INTO TECH, I LOVE THIS.
