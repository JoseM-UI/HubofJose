<h3> Dying or weird TLDs </h3>
<br>
<p> This isn't a a death of ALL TLD's, The internet isn't switching to a new platform, This is just some news and history of weird or promient ones such as .io address or .ooo and even .duck </p>
<p> A TLD stands for "Top-Level-Domain",  and helps identiy the "nature" of a site like if it's .cooking, you can assume its about cooking or .org, its from a organization </p>

<br>
<p> Everyone knows ".com" and ".net", ".edu" etc but I want to talk about some unique ones starting with like ".cool" owned by Identity Digital or Donuts, which has access to ".center", ".international", ".support" for the more serious side they also own ".casino", ".dog", ".bingo", ".exposed", ".fail", ".black",".ninja", ".pink"  and ".wtf" and going more into it they own colours like ".red"</p> 
<p>But on a more serious note, I understand more specific ones like ".dog" maybe animal hospital uses or ".wtf" since it's funny haha but if you use the TLD ".NINJA" -  WHAT ARE YOU SELLING UNDER THAT NAME- ARMOR PLATES, SWORDS, NINJA STARS? </p>
<br>
<h3> the "io" TLD </h3>
<p> Now a more famous one is ".io" which is owned by the British Indian Ocean Territory, surprisingly the people that use it don't live in any of the Indian Ocean territory but it's used because it could be interpreted as Input Output/IO, which is a concept in computing that describes how computers communicate with the outside world. Which is something only some people can appreciate. Github a popular platform that holds projects uses the ".io" TLD but a more common use of the ".io" TLD is A specific game called Agario, which is a very popular game still after 9 years now from writing this. If you want more about Agario here:</p>

<p>There's some talk, about how this TLD is going to be "removed" and how the restrictions are going to be enforced but that brings in issues since so many different groups use the io tag that isn't developers but huge companies like IBM, Ford, and Microsoft since they bought Github for like 7.5 billion - so I don't expect a huge migration to a new TLD, Once it's on the internet it's there forever, but later there are going to be examples of some forgot or dead TLD's  - but I think it's just bait and nothing will change</p>

<p> it's a great video and channel  </p>

<h3> some real Dead TLDs </h3>
<br>

<p>Now for a dead TLD the ".yu" WAS for the country Yugoslavia - but the reason why it ceases to exist now is because it USED to represent Yugoslavia which was "united" (forcefully) under one regime until AFTER WW2. Long story short history were a lot of factors why it fell but the main ones were the death of Josip Broz Tito (the communist leader), a weak government, a lot of violence, economic decline, and the decline of communism and wanting independence in eastern Europe. </p>

<p> you don't know Yugoslavia is now modern-day - Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Macedonia, I MIGHT BE MISSING SOME.</p>

<br>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Yugoslavia/comments/1cxcy1d/what_happened_to_the_yu_domain/"> the .yu TLD "information"</a>
<p>just a quick read if you want to know more </p>

<p>Some other TLDs that are dead -> ".dd" for East Germany, ".cs" for Czechoslovakia, which is kinda disappointing because it has cs which could've meant we didn't get "computer science" or "customer service" and ".zr" for Zaire, ".yd" for South Yemen). </p>



<br>

<h3> the .su tld </h3>
<br>
<p> The TLD ".su" tag, if you don’t know was designed for the Soviet Union, You see the dictatorship/socialist party that was originally inspired by German philosopher Karl Marx which had the idea of making everyone equal because of the different levels of class struggle and how the underclass should rise against the bourgeoisie if it gets awful and share cooperative ownership rather than private,  which would benefit everyone rather than making the gap between the rich and poor larger. That was taken and spread like wildfire in the First World War in Russia with the help of John Lenin after being exiled from Russia and sent to Switzerland and getting back with German aid -- Germany sent him back intending to cause trouble which he did.</p>
<br>
<p> Other party members with Lenin like Trotsky caused Russia to pull out of WW1 and caused an inner revolution after a while Joseph Stalin who was originally a spy to stop this movement joined the party and started his new career from there, now known for being the future of the organization, and after Lenin died the powershift to joesph strain which he immediately jailed/deported /killed any of his opponents and even lose members like Trosky. Then the idea morphed into a form called Stalinism which mostly lost sight of the original idea. Then after a while, new leaders were put into place after Stalin's death and “De-Stalinized”  which were reforms to undo what he messed up. </p>
<br>
<p> In 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev was the last leader the soviet union had before it dissolved only a year later but that's when the TLD of ".su" was made even after the Soviet Union dissolved it still exists now. Now run by the RIPN (Russian Institute for Public Networks) the TLD has become public and was exposed for anyone to use. Many groups have created a new history for this TLD- cybercriminals/hackers and scammers- but that doesn't mean all ".su" sites are horrible. </p>
<p>Trust me you dont notice how many sites have .su until you are bored one day and look </p>
<br>
<a href="https://www.ripn.su/en/"> Modern .su site </a>  
<br>
<a href="http://old.ripn.su/about/en/"> old .su site</a>


<p> But the reason why this was created was that in Europe a new set of internet domains was created like ".pl" (Poland) and even Russia itself had a new one instead of the ".su" domain it called ".ru" or ". PФ" which they still use. </p>

<p>Weird how this started because I was trying to get myself a TLD and just something but looking more into it, definity worth it and will write more later....</p>
