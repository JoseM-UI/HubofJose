          Doing projects is way faster than documenting them. This has a very good chance of NOT being
          updated or having all my projects. If you're really interested, email me.

            <p>
              I wanted to turn my Pi 4 into a full NAS, but between storage limits,
              drive connections, and better hardware options, it just doesn’t make sense long-term.

              This would need some good pre-programmed lines if I want this to work, somewhere proper to host it,
              Discord integration, and constant maintenance. Hilarious idea, but way too much work for something
              that would probably never work properly.

              A funny idea of letting anyone type anything on a wearable pin that's constantly on. It has issues
              because you don't control what people type, and the thickness of how big it is since the screens
              are tiny. There's also the battery source — how would that work? And how would you connect it to
              the internet? So it's just a lot. Cool idea, maybe possible if I get more brains, but for now it's shelved.
