<h1> The Gyro Ball Experience </h1>

<p> 
With Part 8 finally being announced not animated yet.. I wanted to get into cosplay and go as an one of my favorite shows and piece of media Jojo Bizarre Adventure, I love this show so much plus it helps  to prepare for halloween and start making props and planning,

One of the Cosplays I'm considering is to go as Gyro Zeppeli from SBR (Jojo Part 8).  The Angry Vulgar Italian man that helps Johnny Joestar throughout SBR.

I took references and decided I wanted to do a weathered one and a fully “unscaped” one but the files are the same. The only difference is that the hole is smaller and the actual weather effect is the paint and scraping not the 3d printer.
</p>

<h1>Modeling/CAD</h1>

<p>I start with actually modeling it in blender, Simple low poly sphere to start (Icosphere technically) since its easier to shape stuff around then went into sculpting mode and put creases in the needs sports then smoothened them off around the edges</p>

<p>After the shape is what i wanted i raise the subdivision modifier and got ti so its able to gte that smooth shape and finally using the make manifold blender addon its ready to be sent into the printer</p>
<br>

<p>my original plan was to have the pull string keychain mechanism inside the ball so i can use the smaller ball side as a ring, that why I made a giant cylinder hole within the model of mine, because i thought i would need all that space and need it to move freely but i reeves it having the main pulley mechanism outside as the ring so that was a tad easier</p>

<br><h4>Switching to Onshape</h4></p>

<p>I made a plug using TPU to hold it, and use a tad of glue and lighter to solidify it, for future references for people doing this, I recommended waiting until you see the weight of the ball first 
before because it'll sag otherwise, so I would recommend waiting for the end and confirm the weight so the string will have a tight pull.</p>

<br>

<p>I modified the pull string keychain I got from my work into a ring for me to hold and retract it, so maybe this stl/3mf file will be niche unless someone has something similar to it.</p>

<br>

<p>Finally, the last 3D printed part is a rubber cap on the ring part (TPU) so that when I toss the ball it'll come back and hit the rubber hopefully soften and dampen the force so that the ring and ball won't get damaged over usage.</p>



<h1>3d Printing time (Prusa Core One)</h1>
<h5>I'll add a gif of it printing... totally</h5>

<p>Exported the model as a stl and 3mf just in case, in PrusaSlicer put organic supports around the center to make sure the sphere stays up and doesn't make any bad overhangs granted this is on the inside soo, Took a while with 10-15% gyroid infill but it should be worth it since I know it'll be coming back with speed and force. I printed this PLA with the “Structure Profile" already made by Prusa. </p>

<p>I used any basic wood filler to fill it instead of bondo but either would work but I've previously worked with Bondo and yes it is much stronger but it's not as cheap and wood filler doesn't turn into a rubbery layer afterwards. But I put a couple layers after sanding it down with 100-600 grit sand paper and layering more on it until most of the layers aren't visible.
<br><br>
(some tips for wood filler is that its solidable and able to get into all the gaps and layer lines and drys pretty quick so i cant wait to but a 80 gallon load for future proofing, this doesnt mean its the best use solution for all cases like for my daft punk helmet i needed to use bondo to get the harder cracked parts)
<br><br>
I used a soldering gun to melt the two pieces together and used wood filler and sanded it down
Something that is useful to have is a file or a stick to use the sandpaper to get the ridges, so might have those around as well also using a clamp to prevent moving. A small tube of super glue might be useful as well just in case.

I've wondered which way was better, printing the pieces, filling , sanding then painting, or putting the pieces together then filling then sanding and then finally painting to see which one would give me the better result,
<br><br> I'll post the results later to make you decide.</p>

<h4>Granted my sanding and filling experience isn't the best and some parts are visible and horrible but other sides look good in my opinion.</h4>

<h1>Spray Painting and Priming </h1>

<p>The paint i got was the white filler primer to coat and sand down and i put 3 layers of that afterwards i put the glossy black spray paint put 2 coats of that and wet sanded it with 2000 grit (optional) because that's what's needed to get that special colour mix to work properly, I've chosen the Green/Brown mix to get those cool angles in the light and finally afterwards i put a couple of layers of clear spray paint to protect it from usage</p>

<h1>Result /Files</h1>
<p>Its not my best work, it has alot of issues, I see alot of things i could improve on, but its nt bad for a first offical cosplay attempt</p>
